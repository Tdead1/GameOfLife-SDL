# GameOfLife-SDL
## Now platform independent!
Use CMake to generate your project, and don't forget to install SDL on your machine (and, if you're on windows, point your cmake to the right folder to include it! The project is written for C++17 and above. 

This project is meant to be as barebones as possible, with a single gameplay class and a single graphics interface. It's mainly used for testing different small prototypes by me.
